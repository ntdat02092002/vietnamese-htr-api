# API for [fontend App](https://github.com/TruongNoDame/vietnamese_htr_frontend/tree/main)

Our repo will provide a Vietnamese handwriting recognition API using FastAPI. The models we use are two state-of-the-art models of scene text recognition, [CLIP4STR](https://github.com/VamosC/CLIP4STR) and [PARSeq](https://github.com/baudm/parseq).

To use our code we require you to have a GPU.
